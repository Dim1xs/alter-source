haha source spaghetti go brr
----------------------------
Alter Source is an extremely epic Source Engine fork, currently under heavy development.
It's main purpose is to make modding easier, reduce the spaghetti code and for game fixes.
The reason that it's a Multiplayer mod instead of a Singleplayer one, is because that it's possible to add Gamemodes thingy.
So wake up, Mr Freeman, wake up and, smell the ashes.
